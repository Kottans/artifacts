# How it is planned to be
- **front** - [ASCI kottan](https://github.com/Quodnon/artifacts/raw/master/wear_sources/js-course-shirt/v.0.3_cyrilic/js-course-shirt-front_v.0.3.ai)(adobe dc / adobe illustrator)

- **back** - code `jsCourse.js`

## TODO:
- transform to vector **`.ai`**
- suggestions are appreciated

## KEEP IN MIND
all this code must fit an average size of human's back
